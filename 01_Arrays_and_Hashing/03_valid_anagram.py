https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/
Difficulty: Easy

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Examples:
    Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
    Output: true

    Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
    Output: false

Constraints:
    - 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
    - s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # Hint: Count character frequencies using a hash map or Counter.
        # Compare the two frequency maps. They must be identical.
        pass
