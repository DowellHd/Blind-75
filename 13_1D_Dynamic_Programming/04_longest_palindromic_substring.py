5. Longest Palindromic Substring
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/
Difficulty: Medium

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Examples:
    Input: s = "babad"
    Output: "bab" (or "aba")

    Input: s = "cbbd"
    Output: "bb"

Constraints:
    - 1 <= s.length <= 1000
"""


class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Hint: Expand around center. For each index, try expanding outward
        # for both odd-length and even-length palindromes. Track the longest.
        pass
