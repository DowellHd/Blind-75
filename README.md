## Study Roadmap

Work through the categories **in order**. Each builds on patterns from the previous ones.

| Phase | Categories | Focus | Difficulty |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **1 - Foundations** | Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window | Core patterns you'll use everywhere | Easy-Medium |
| **2 - Data Structures** | Stack, Binary Search, Linked List | Fundamental data structure manipulation | Easy-Medium |
| **3 - Trees & Graphs** | Trees, Tries, Heap, Graphs, Advanced Graphs | Recursive thinking, BFS/DFS | Medium-Hard |
| **4 - Dynamic Programming** | 1D DP, 2D DP | State transitions, memoization | Medium-Hard |
| **5 - Pattern Recognition** | Backtracking, Greedy, Intervals, Math, Bit Manipulation | Specialized techniques | Easy-Hard |

## Pattern Cheat Sheet

| Pattern | When to Use It |
|---------|---------------|
| **Hash Map** | Need O(1) lookup, counting, grouping |
| **Two Pointers** | Sorted array, pair/triplet search, palindrome |
| **Sliding Window** | Contiguous subarray/substring with constraint |
| **Stack** | Matching brackets, monotonic sequences, undo |
| **Binary Search** | Sorted/rotated array, search space reduction |
| **Linked List** | In-place manipulation, fast/slow pointers |
| **Tree DFS** | Path problems, validation, construction |
| **Tree BFS** | Level-order processing |
| **Trie** | Prefix matching, word search |
| **Heap** | Top-K, streaming median, merge K lists |
| **Backtracking** | Generate all combinations/permutations |
| **Graph DFS/BFS** | Connected components, cycle detection, traversal |
| **Topological Sort** | Dependency ordering (course schedule, alien dict) |
| **Union-Find** | Dynamic connectivity, components |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure |
| **Greedy** | Local optimal = global optimal |
| **Intervals** | Merge, insert, schedule meetings |
| **Bit Manipulation** | XOR tricks, counting bits, no arithmetic operators |
